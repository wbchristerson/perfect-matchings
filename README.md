# Maximum Matchings

This application demonstrates an algorithm for finding maximum matchings in bipartite graphs. For a detailed explanation of the concepts involved, see `Maximum_Matchings.pdf`. The project was created using Python along with the pygame and livewires libraries.

## Navigating Through The application



## Downloading The Project

* You will need to have Python installed, as well as the pygame and livewires libraries. The version of livewires used for this project was taken from this [download](http://www.delmarlearning.com/companions/content/1435455002/downloads/index.asp?isbn=1435455002) (which also contains downloads for Python and pygame), under "Book related software".
* To download, you can clone the repository using this terminal command:
```
git clone https://github.com/wbchristerson/perfect-matchings.git
```

Alternatively, follow the instructions below to download to a hard drive:
* Click the green "Clone or download" button above then choose "Download ZIP".
* Find the folder `reactnd-project-readable-starter-master` in your Downloads folder or wherever it was placed on your device.
* Right click and choose "Extract All".

* To install all dependencies for the API server and to run it from the command line, run the following commands in the terminal:
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, run the following commands for the front-end
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm start`
